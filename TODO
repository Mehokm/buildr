1. maybe do multiple build types.  like buildr build-env -i env
  - -i will be the interpolation type or template type.
  - it will help buildr know where to pull the data to interpolate
  - the convention for filenames could be TYPE.buildr (excluding cmd.buildr)
  - try to make room for multiple types to combine
